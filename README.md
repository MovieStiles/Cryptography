Cryptography Python Scripts
================================================

This repo is to show all of the scripts I developed over the course of the last semester taking Cryptography.
Initially they were very rough and really only meant for my use, but over time I will clean them up (such as organizing them into actual functions), and post everything I used to help me crack the ciphers taught in this class.

The purpose of these is too help others with introducing themselves to cryptography, so I include a lot of documentation on what the different ciphers are and a few other definitions to try and help people who aren't as familiar with the concepts used.

Included Ciphers
-------------------------------------------------

- Monoalphabetic Ciphers

	- Additive Cipher (Caesar Shift)
	
	- Multiplicative Cipher
	
	- Affine Cipher
	
	- Keyword Cipher

	
- Polyalphabetic Ciphers

	- Vignere Cipher
	
	
- Polygraphic Ciphers

	- Hills System

	
- Public Key Cryptography

	- RSA Algorithm
	
	- Signature Authentication
	
	- Diffie - Hellman Key Exchange
	
	- Massey - Omura System

	
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography

	- Elliptic Curves
	
	- Diffie - Hellman using Elliptic Curves

As well as other small misc scripts I used such as a letter frequency counting script.

Some of these include pieces of code that I found elsewhere, which I credit appropriately.

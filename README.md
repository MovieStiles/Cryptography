#Cryptography Python Scripts

This repo is to show all of the scripts I developed over the course of the last semester taking Cryptography.
Initially they were very rough and really only meant for my use, but over time I will clean them up (such as organizing them into actual functions), and post everything I used to help me crack the ciphers taught in this class.

The purpose of these is too help others with introducing themselves to cryptography, so I include a lot of documentation on what the different ciphers are and a few other definitions to try and help people who aren't as familiar with the concepts used.
Not all of this code is meant to outright crack the cipher for you (aka finding the decryption key and outputting the resulting plaintext).  For the monoalphabetic ciphers, it can often be trivial enough that the code certainly can do that, but more often than not this code will only help in some of the analysis of the ciphertext.
From there it's up to you.

Some of these include pieces of code that I found elsewhere, which I credit appropriately.

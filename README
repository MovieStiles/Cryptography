This repo is to show all of the scripts I developed over the course of the last semester taking Cryptography.
Initially they were very rough and really only meant for my use, but over time I will clean them up (such as organizing them into actual functions)
and post everything I used to help me crack the ciphers taught in this class.

Over time, these will include:

Monoalphabetic Ciphers
	Additive Cipher (Caesar Shift)
	Multiplicative Cipher
	Affine Cipher

Polyalphabetic Ciphers
	Vignere Cipher
	
Polygraphic Ciphers
	Hills System

Public Key Cryptography
	RSA Algorithm
	Signature Authentication
	Diffie - Hellman Key Exchange
	Massey - Omura System

Elliptic Curve Cryptography
	Diffie - Hellman using Elliptic Curves

Knapsack Cryptosystem

As well as other small misc scripts I used such as a letter frequency counting script.

Some of these include pieces of code that I found elsewhere, which I credit appropriately.

This is just to help out anyone else who wishes to introduce themselves to these concepts.
